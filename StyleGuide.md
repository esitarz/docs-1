## The OrderCloud Documentation Vision

All OrderCloud.io documentation should make it easier for all users to have a smooth path to development on the OrderCloud.io platform. To do this, documentation **must** be accurate and **easy to maintain**. 

The users of the OrderCloud Documentation are *Developers* and *Business Users*. Make sure Documentation content helps them both.

## Content & Tone

OrderCloud Documentation is a reference document. It should avoid overly casual language, but it shouldn't be overly formal, either.

- Avoid questions as a rhetorical device. 
- Don't address the reader as "you".
- Avoid excessive jokes.
- Avoid using "please" in instructions unless some step in the procedure causes inconvenience for the user or represents a workaround for some system limitation.
    + By the same token, avoid using "sorry" as well.

All OrderCloud.io content should be *clear*, *understandable*, and *brief*. 

- Don't be wordy if possible
- Don't use in-group terminology or slang
- Keep the content easy to understand.
    + If unsure, use tools that show [readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability).
    + Good tools include [Typely](), [Dillanger](), and the [Hemmingway Editor](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/).
- Link to other Documentation rather than re-explain a concept.
- Use short, plain words when possible
- Donâ€™t make up new words or modify their usual meaning.
- Always remember that a developer may not be particularly familiar with API-based development -- use standard terminology and link out to {} standards to provide definitions when nessecary.

All OrderCloud Documentation should be culturally neutral. 

- Don't use colloquialisms, idioms, etc.
- Don't assume the user is in any particular timezone.
- Don't assume the gender of the user.


All OrderCloud Documentation should be [Accessible]().

- Don't assume keyboard or mouse input in your directions.
- Do not use [visual or directional language]() for descirptions or steps.
