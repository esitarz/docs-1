# OrderCloud.io Documentation

This is the repository for the [OrderCloud.io](https://ordercloud.io/) platform's [documentation site](https://ordercloud-api.github.io/docs/). We use [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican) to generate this site.

## Contributions

We welcome additions, edits, and corrections to our documentation, with a few caveats.

First, the API documentation is generated by our OrderCloud Platform. So, if there is a change you would like made to our [API Reference content](https://ordercloud-api.github.io/docs/api-reference.html), please do not edit the documentation here, but instead raise a [issue]() in this repo. Any pull requests with changes to the API Reference content will be returned.

Second, all content changes or additions require a pull request to be approved by the OrderCloud maintainers. We may decline a pull request with comments asking for the content to align more closely with our [style guide](style_guide.md).

If you don't have an edit to make to the documentation content, but do have questions about the documentation, please open an [issue]() in this repo.


### Local Development

If you want to locally develop on this static site, or to view the edits you're making to documentation content as you work, this is how to get set up locally:

**dependancies**:
- our current theme, `/themes/boots4pelican` requires [Ruby SASS](http://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass)
- [python 3]()

1. pull down this repository
2. locally, `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get all python dependancies
3. in the `/output` folder, run `python -m http.server`
4. in a second shell, run `pelican content` in the root of the repo folder
5. go to `localhost:8000` and tada, you've got a local instance of the site.

[Pelican Site Generation Docs](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/publish.html#site-generation)

If you'd like to edit documentation content, make your edits to the markdown files in the `/content` folder, and regenerate the site.
The folder structure in the `/content` folder is syntactically relevant -- it forms the category and sub-category structure for each documentation article. Categories thus do not need to be set in the content markdown header information.

We currently do not use tags as part of our content organization.

|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `pages`                 | A Pelican infrastructure-related directory, this is currently used for landing page content.                                |

#### Documentation File Structure

We use largely [Github-flavored Markdown](https://docs.python.org/3.5/). Each markdown file needs a header block, like the following:

```
---
Title: Angularjs: Application Files
Date: 2018-03-19 15:32:44.250255
---
```
