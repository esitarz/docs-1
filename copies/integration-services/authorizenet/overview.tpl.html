            <a href="http://www.authorize.net/" target="_blank">Authorize.Net</a> enables merchants to authorize, settle and manage credit card and electronic check transactions
            securely and reliably. Authorize.Net merchants encompass a wide variety of business industries: information, communication, government, sports, religion, education,
            gourmet foods and many others. Regardless of their business type, merchants benefit by providing their customers with convenient, secure and reliable payment options
            without needing to invest in the ongoing development, support and legal compliance of a sophisticated in-house payment system.
