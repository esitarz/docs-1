            Delete Credit Card Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
            When a customer within your buyer application deletes a credit card, the integration endpoint can be called in order to delete that card on OrderCloud.io as
            well as Authorize.Net. The Customer Payment Profile will be removed on Authorize.Net, followed by the card being deleted on OrderCloud.io. If either call fails,
            the response from that particular call will be returned. Otherwise, the response will simply be a 204 No Content. If the card is shared, meaning <code>Shared</code> was set to <code>true</code> when the card was created,
            <code>Shared</code> must be passed as <code>true</code> when deleting.
        </p>

            Error Handling
        </h2>
        <p>
            During the credit card delete process, the Authorize.Net Customer Payment Profile will first be deleted. Next, the card will be deleted on OrderCloud.io.
        </p>
        <p>
            Errors will return the exact response directly from the Authorize.Net or OrderCloud.io endpoint that failed. However, if any required fields are missing,
            a 400 error will be returned before any of the update process is executed.
        </p>
        <h3>Validation Response</h3>
        <p>
            In the case that a required field is missing from your request, the following response will be returned containing a unique ErrorCode and Message, as well as the
            request body sent during the call. The possible ErrorCodes and Messages are listed below.
