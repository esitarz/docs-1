            Prior Authorization Capture Transaction Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
            In the case that Authorize Only was previously used for a payment, Prior Authorization Capture Transaction can be used to actually capture the payment.
            This method will first capture the payment on Authorize.Net, then create an additional transaction on the previously created payment on OrderCloud.io.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the capture transaction is successful, but there is an error while creating the transaction on OrderCloud.io, the Authorize.Net transaction will be voided.

            Error Handling
        </h2>
        <p>
            During the prior authorization capture process, the Authorize.Net payment authorization will be captured, followed by the creation of the transaction on OrderCloud.io.
            In the case that the OrderCloud.io step fails, the transaction will be voided automatically on Authorize.Net.
        </p>
        <p>
            Errors will return the exact response directly from the Authorize.Net or OrderCloud.io endpoint that failed. However, if any required fields are missing,
            a 400 error will be returned before any of the update process is executed.
        </p>
        <h3>Validation Response</h3>
        <p>
            In the case that a required field is missing from your request, the following response will be returned containing a unique ErrorCode and Message, as well as the
            request body sent during the call. The possible ErrorCodes and Messages are listed below.
