            Configuring Catalog Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to be considered when estimating shipping rates, products and their price schedules will need a few things set up first.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="guides-section" id="ConfiguringCatalogApplyShipping">
        <h2>
            <i class="fa fa-link" ngclipboard-success="documentation.copyLinkSuccess(e)" ngclipboard data-clipboard-text="{{documentation.generateLink('ConfiguringCatalogApplyShipping')}}"></i>
            ApplyShipping
        </h2>
        <p>
            First, <code>ApplyShipping</code> will need to be set to true on the price schedule assigned to the product.
            Any Line Items containing Products without this value set to true on its Price Schedule will be ignored when calculating shipping rates.
            Here's a sample Price Schedule with this configuration set:
        </p>
        <pre prism class="language-json"
             source='
{
"ID": "SamplePriceSchedule",
"Name": "Sample",
"ApplyTax": false,
"ApplyShipping": true,
"MinQuantity": 1,
"MaxQuantity": null,
"UseCumulativeQuantity": false,
"RestrictedQuantity": false,
"OrderType": "Standard",
"PriceBreaks": [
{
    "Quantity": 1,
    "Price": 10
}
],
"xp": null
}

    <section class="guides-section" id="ConfiguringCatalogShipWeight">
        <h2>
            <i class="fa fa-link" ngclipboard-success="documentation.copyLinkSuccess(e)" ngclipboard data-clipboard-text="{{documentation.generateLink('ConfiguringCatalogShipWeight')}}"></i>
            ShipWeight
        </h2>
        <p>
            Next, a <code>ShipWeight</code> (in lbs.) should to be set on the Product being ordered to provide accurate shipping rates. If a value is not set, the Product will still
            be included in the calculation. However, a weight of <code>0</code> will be used when calculating rates, resulting in inaccurate rates.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="guides-section" id="ConfiguringCatalogShipFromAddressID">
        <h2>
            <i class="fa fa-link" ngclipboard-success="documentation.copyLinkSuccess(e)" ngclipboard data-clipboard-text="{{documentation.generateLink('ConfiguringCatalogShipFromAddressID')}}"></i>
            ShipFromAddressID
        </h2>
        <p>
            Next, a <code>ShipFromAddressID</code> needs to be set on the Product being ordered to be considered when estimating shipping rates. The value for this field
            should be a previously created Admin Address ID. Each Product should have the <code>ShipFromAddressID</code> set for the location it is being shipped from. Products being shipped
            from separate locations will be considered a separate shipment within OrderCloud.io, meaning Line Items will be grouped by these
            addresses (as well as the item's Shipping Address) when calculating rates. Here's a sample Admin Address and a Product containing that Admin Address' ID,
            as well as a <code>ShipWeight</code>:
