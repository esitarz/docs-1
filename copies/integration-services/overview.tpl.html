            Shipping Rates Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
            OrderCloud.io offers the ability to provide weight-based shipping rate estimates within your storefronts based on the commercial shipping rates.
            Supported carriers within this integration currently include USPS, UPS, and FedEx.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once configured, the OrderCloud.io Shipping Rates integration offers three methods: <i>GetRates</i>, <i>GetLineItemRates</i>, and <i>SetShippingCost</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            GetRates will automatically separate the Order's Line Items into shipments based on their <code>ShippingAddress</code> and the Line Item Product's <code>ShipFromAddress</code>.
            Rates will be returned based on these determined shipments.
        </p>
        <p>
            GetLineItemRates will obtain shipping rates for each Line Item individually, regardless of the item’s <code>ShippingAddress</code> and the Line Item Product’s <code>ShipFromAddress</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            SetShippingCost simply allows your application to set an Order's <code>ShippingCost</code> value once the user has selected their desired shipper(s) for their Order.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additional configuration options include rate adjustments and manual shippers. Rate adjustments allows you to automatically increase or decrease the estimated shipping
            rates by a percentage or flat rate. This can be configured at a global or carrier level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Manual shippers allows you to configure shipper options with a Name and flat rate Price. This price will not be adjusted using the rate adjustments described above.
            Manual shippers can be configured to always be returned or to only be returned when no shipping rate estimates are returned. This may be caused by a determined shipment with
            a weight greater than 150 lbs., invalid addresses, or simply because the carrier's web services are not functioning properly.
        </p>
        <p>
            OrderCloud.io's Shipping Rates integration not only requires configuration for the integration endpoint itself,
            but for the products that will be included for shipping rate estimates as well. These topics will be covered in the following sections.
