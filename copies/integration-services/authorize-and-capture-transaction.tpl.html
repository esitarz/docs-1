            Authorize and Capture Transaction Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
            Authorizing and Capturing a credit card transaction is one of the most involved methods included in this integration. This method will create a new
            Customer Payment Profile on Authorize.Net and credit card on OrderCloud.io if one does not already exist, authorize and capture a payment transaction
            on Authorize.Net, create a payment on OrderCloud.io tied to the authenticated userâ€™s current Order (if a payment already exists, simply pass the ID in <code>PaymentID</code>),
            and also create a transaction tied to that payment.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the transaction authorization and capture are successful, but there is an error while creating the payment or transaction on OrderCloud.io,
            the Authorize.Net transaction will be voided.

            Error Handling
        </h2>
        <p>
            During the authorization and capture process, the Authorize.Net payment transaction will be created first, followed by the payment and transaction on OrderCloud.io.
            In the case that the OrderCloud.io steps fail, the transaction will be voided automatically on Authorize.Net.
        </p>
        <p>
            Errors will return the exact response directly from the Authorize.Net or OrderCloud.io endpoint that failed. However, if any required fields are missing,
            a 400 error will be returned before any of the update process is executed.
        </p>
        <h3>Validation Response</h3>
        <p>
            In the case that a required field is missing from your request, the following response will be returned containing a unique ErrorCode and Message, as well as the
            request body sent during the call. The possible ErrorCodes and Messages are listed below.
