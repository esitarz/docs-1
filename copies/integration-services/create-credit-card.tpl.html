            Create Credit Card Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
            When a customer within your buyer application creates a credit card, the integration endpoint can be called in order to create that card within OrderCloud.io
            as well as Authorize.Net. The card will created as a personal card by default. However, passing <code>true</code> for <code>Shared</code> assign the card to the entire 
            Buyer Organization provided in the <code>BuyerID</code>.
            
            This endpoint will create a Customer Profile within Authorize.Net if one does not already exist (Authorize.Net Customer Profile ID
            will be saved as xp.AuthorizeNetProfileID on the User), create a Customer Payment Profile within Authorize.Net that securely stores the tokenized data for the card,
            and finally create and assign the card on OrderCloud.io to the authenticate user.

            Error Handling
        </h2>
        <p>
            During the credit card create process, the Authorize.Net Customer Profile and Customer Payment Profile are created (if necessary) first, followed by the creation
            of the card on OrderCloud.io. Therefore, if any errors occur, they will occur in that order. Errors will return the exact response directly from the Authorize.Net
            or OrderCloud.io endpoint that failed. However, if any required fields are missing, a 400 error will be returned before any of the creation process is executed.
        </p>
        <h3>Validation Response</h3>
        <p>
            In the case that a required field is missing from your request, the following response will be returned containing a unique ErrorCode and Message, as well as the
            request body sent during the call. The possible ErrorCodes and Messages are listed below.
