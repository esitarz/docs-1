        <h2>Application Constants</h2>
        <p><code>src/app/app.constants.json</code> is a small, yet powerful file host a JSON object of key value pairs to be used throughout the application. From this object, the build process will generate a file containing AngularJS constants:
            <a href="https://github.com/ordercloud-api/angular-seller/blob/development/gulp.config.js#L86">here</a>, which can then be injected into your various AngularJS controllers, factories, providers, etc. Think of it as a base configuration or
            settings file for your application.</p>

        <h2>Process Environment Variable Overrides</h2>
        <p>The constants provided above can be overwritten within your hosting providers application settings. For example, within Heroku, you can override these constants using their <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#setting-up-config-vars-for-a-deployed-application">Config Variables</a>.
            This is accomplished in the <a href="https://github.com/ordercloud-api/angular-seller/blob/development/gulp.config.js#L116-L121"><code>gulp.config.js</code></a> file, which can be customized to include additional application constants.</p>
