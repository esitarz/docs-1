        <p>The OrderCloud team welcomes any and all open-source contributors to create a pull request for bug fixes, enhancements, or new features (pending review).</p>
        <p>Prior to writing any code, be sure to open an issue (<a href="https://github.com/ordercloud-api/angular-seller/issues">Seller</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ordercloud-api/angular-seller/issues">Buyer</a>) with a detailed description of your
            problem or proposed enhancement. We may already be on our way to delivering what you want!</p>
        <p>We use GitHub's standard <a href="https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962">fork, branch, pull request workflow</a> and expect any contributors to follow a similar workflow. Always provide a passing unit test for any fix or enhancement.</p>
        <p>Thank you for being a part of the <a href="http://community.ordercloud.io">OrderCloud Community</a> and helping make our resources the best they can be!</p>
