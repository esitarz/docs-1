        <p>OrderCloud.io is a RESTful API that enables you to create complex, custom B2B eCommerce solutions.</p>
        <p>This guide is meant to get you started with OrderCloud.io as quickly as possible. In order to accomplish this,
            weâ€™ve stripped away some of the detail, so keep an eye out for links to relevant guides that provide much
            more in-depth explanations.

        <p>The first thing you will need to do is <a ng-href="{{application.links.dashboard + '/register'}}">create an account</a>. Registration is free and gives you
            access to the entire OrderCloud.io platform.</p>
            <!--TODO: Add image once dashboard subdomain design is complete-->
        <p>After you submit your email address, you will be sent a verification code which will be required to complete the registration process.

               data-clipboard-text="{{documentation.generateLink('FirstOrg')}}"></i> Your First Seller Organization</h2>
        <p>Now that you have an OrderCloud.io account you can navigate to your <a href="https://dashboard.ordercloud.io">dashboard</a> and access your first <a
                ui-sref="platform-guides({sectionID:'getting-started',guideID:'introduction-to-ordercloud',detailID:'SupportsComplexCommerce'})">seller organization</a>.</p>
        <p>
            It is the highest
            level container that encompasses everything else in OrderCloud.io (applications, products, pricing, users, etc.). You
            can have multiple Seller Organizations; however, data is not shared between them.
        </p>
        <p>Newly created Seller Organizations come with a "default access" application giving you immediate access to the API however you can also create your own. To do this first click on the seller applications pane on the left and then click the <label class="btn btn-sm btn-inline btn-success"> <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> New</label> button located in the upper right hand corner. </p>
        <p>Using the API Console is the simplest way to start exploring OrderCloud.io; however, understanding the fundamentals
            of how to access and use the API on it's own is extremely important for any OrderCloud.io developer.

       <h2><i class="fa fa-link" ngclipboard-success="documentation.copyLinkSuccess(e)" ngclipboard
              data-clipboard-text="{{documentation.generateLink('QuickStartAuth')}}"></i> Authentication</h2>
        <p>Before you are able to interact with the OrderCloud.io API you will need to get an <code>access_token</code> from the auth server. The
            following sections will include raw request and response examples to the OAuth API.
        </p>
        <p>The first thing you need is the <code>ClientID</code>. This unique identifier represents a single application on OrderCloud.io.
        Feel free to use the ClientID from the "default access" application that was automatically created on your first Seller Organization.
        </p>
        <figure class="oc-docs-image-outline">
            <img src="/assets/images/docs-guides/getting-started/quick-start-guide/quick-start-guide-1.jpg" alt="">
        </figure>
        <p>The second thing you will need is a list of roles, or in OAuth terms, scope. For this example you are not authenticating as an actual user (because we haven't created one yet). Instead, you will be taking advantage of a useful developer role, <code>DevCenterImpersonate</code>". This role will allow you to use the password grant type workflow with your own Dev Center username and password.
        </p>
        <p>Along with our special DevCenterImpersonate role we will also request "FullAccess". Being the owners of this Organization it's safe to say we can access and change any data related to it. Giving real users "FullAccess" is highly discouraged, a subset of roles helps protect your application from malicious attacks or oblivious users.</p>
        <p>Using your ClientID, roles list, and Dev Center username/password, request an access token following the example below:</p>
        <br>
        Request
        <pre class="language-http" prism source="POST https://auth.ordercloud.io/oauth/token HTTP/1.1

examplepass&scope=DevCenterImpersonate+FullAccess
        "></pre>
        <br>
        Response
        <pre class="language-http" prism source='HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json;

{
"access_token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJ",

               data-clipboard-text="{{documentation.generateLink('SubsequentRequests')}}"></i> Subsequent Requests</h2>
        <p>Using the access_token from the OAuth response make your first <code>GET</code> request to the UserPerspecive &rarr; Me &rarr; <a ui-sref="api-reference({sectionID: 'MeAndMyStuff', resourceID:'Me', endpointID: 'Get'})">Get</a> endpoint. This will return the
            details for the currently authenticated user. (In this case, you will appear as the default user because we authenticated as a developer). Make
            sure you put your <code>access_token</code> in the Authentication header before making the request.
