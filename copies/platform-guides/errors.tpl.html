        <p>OrderCloud.io uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In
            general, codes in the <code>2xx</code> range indicate success and codes in the <code>4xx</code> range indicate an error failed
            given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter). Only when something goes terribly wrong
            on our end will you receive a <code>500</code> response. As long as the platform is responding you can count on
            the response body taking a standard shape.</p>
