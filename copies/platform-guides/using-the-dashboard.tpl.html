		<h2><i class="fa fa-link" ngclipboard-success="documentation.copyLinkSuccess(e)" ngclipboard
			   data-clipboard-text="{{documentation.generateLink('SellerSettings')}}"></i> Seller Organization Settings</h2>
		<p>This is the page you will land on when opening any organization. The view has two tabs: <b>Seller Options</b> and <b>Contributors</b>.</p>
		<h3><i class="fa fa-cog"></i> Seller Options</h3>
		<p>The organization owner has exclusive permission to change the seller options including updating the organization name,
			transferring the org to a contributing developer, or deleting the seller entirely. If you're a contributor, you can
			choose to leave the organization from this view.</p>
		<h3><i class="fa fa-user"></i> Contributors</h3>
		<p>Most B2B eCommerce projects require some level of collaboration. By sharing your organization with other team members
			on OrderCloud you can all work together on a single seller. Once a new contributor is added you can refine their access
			to your organization by adjusting their <b>permissions</b> & <b>data access</b>.
		</p>
		<h4>Contributor Permissions</h4>
		<figure class="oc-docs-image-outline">
			<img src="assets/images/docs-guides/getting-started/dashboard/permissions.jpg"/>
		</figure>
		<p>Each permission controls whether or not a given contributor can access specific dashboard functionality for
			your seller organization. For example, you may have one contributor that is responsible for creating webhooks
			and integrations and another who is responsible for setting up security profiles for your end users.</p>
		<h4>Contributor Data Access</h4>
		<figure class="oc-docs-image-outline">
			<img src="assets/images/docs-guides/getting-started/dashboard/data_access.jpg"/>
		</figure>
		<p>Data Access gives you control over which roles (if any) a given contributor can request when using the
			OrderCloud API with this seller organization or any of it's buyer organizations. A contributor with
			<code>FullAccess</code> here will have total control over any of the data under the seller organization.
			It is strongly recommended you use a combination of the granular roles that enable each developer to accomplish
			their project tasks to avoid unwanted or unexpected changes to your organization's data.
			OrderCloud roles are covered in-depth later in this guide.</p>

		<h2><i class="fa fa-link" ngclipboard-success="documentation.copyLinkSuccess(e)" ngclipboard

		<p>Seller and Buyer Organizations each have their own set of applications. Clicking <em>"Seller Applications"</em> in the left nav will give you a list of applications that can be used by your organization's <a ui-sref="api-reference({sectionID: 'Seller', resourceID: 'AdminUsers'})">Admin Users</a>. Buyer Applications are visible under each respective Buyer Organization and can be accessed by the <a ui-sref="api-reference({sectionID: 'Buyers', resourceID: 'Users'})">Users</a> under that buyer.
		</p>
		<h3>Application Settings</h3>
		<p>Opening an individual application will bring you to the <b>Settings</b> tab for that application. Seller Organization owners
			and contributors with permission to administer applications can update application information in this tab and activate/deactivate
			the application. Within this tab youâ€™ll find the following:
		</p>
		<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">

				<col width="25%">

			<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th scope="row">Client ID</th>

					It is a general rule that one front-end application be associated with a single Client ID or "application".</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th scope="row">Client Secret</th>
				<td>This is an optional elevated level of security. It allows you to require an additional keyphrase
					in all authentication requests. It is also used as part of the <a ui-sref="platform-guides({sectionID:'authentication',guideID:'oauth2-workflows', detailID:'ClientCredentialsGrantType'})">Client

		<h3 id="ActiveWebhooks">Active Webhooks</h3>
		<p>The <em>"webhooks"</em> tab is visible to owners and contributors with permission to administer webhooks.
			This is where you will enable / disable webhooks for a given application. Create a webhook once
			using the <a href="#Webhooks">Webhooks</a> feature and apply it to one or many applications using this workflow.

		<h3 id="ActiveIntegrations">Active Integrations</h3>

		<h2><i class="fa fa-link" ngclipboard-success="documentation.copyLinkSuccess(e)" ngclipboard
			   data-clipboard-text="{{documentation.generateLink('SecurityProfiles')}}"></i> Security Profiles</h2>
		<p>This feature is available to organization owners and contributors with permission to administer security.
			Security Profiles are groupings of roles that can be later assigned to admin and buyer users using the
			<a ui-sref="api-reference({sectionID: 'AuthenticationAndAuthorization', resourceID:'SecurityProfiles'})">Security Profiles API</a>.</p>
		<p>The granular nature of OrderCloud roles enables you to control exactly which API endpoints and/or data each user can access within
			your organization (similar to your contributor's data access!). In general, an <b>Admin</b> role allows
			read and write access of a given resource while a <b>Reader</b> role allows only read access.
		</p>
		<figure class="oc-docs-image-outline">
			<img src="assets/images/docs-guides/getting-started/dashboard/security.jpg"/>
		</figure>
		<p>It is <b>strongly discouraged</b> and considered a security risk to give your admin or buyer users the
			<code>FullAccess</code> role. While it may be convenient to use in the early stages of development - it
			is <b>always</b> better to give end users a combination of more granular roles that align to the actions
			they will be taking in the application.
		</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">If you can't seem to find the role that's right for your users, please <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ordercloud.io/contact">contact us</a> with your request and

		<p>The <a ui-sref="platform-guides({sectionID:'basic-api-features',guideID:'extended-properties'})">Extended Properties (XP)</a>
			feature was created to improve the performance of filtered API queries. Instead of automatically indexing any new
			XP, we ask developers to define which properties they would like to be indexed beforehand. Once

		<h2><i class="fa fa-link" ngclipboard-success="documentation.copyLinkSuccess(e)" ngclipboard
			   data-clipboard-text="{{documentation.generateLink('Webhooks')}}"></i> Webhooks</h2>
		<p>Webhooks enable user-defined HTTP callbacks for all writeable endpoints in the OrderCloud API. They can be
			used to perform follow up tasks such as updating an external CRM system when a user updates their profile,
			or send an email through a 3rd party system when an order is submitted. Webhooks are fundamentally designed
			to provide maximum flexibility within the integrated solution.
		</p>
		<p>Owners and contributors with permission to administer webhooks can access this feature. OrderCloud requires standard webhook information:</p>
		<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
			<colgroup>
				<col width="25%">
			</colgroup>
			<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th scope="row">Payload URL</th>
				<td>The URL OrderCloud will send data to.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th scope="row">Secret</th>
				<td>OrderCloud will encrypt this secret and pass it through the request headers.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th scope="row">Trigger Events</th>
				<td>
					The OrderCloud API endpoints that will trigger the webhook event. Webhooks can only be triggered by endpoints that write to the database (<code>POST</code>/<code>PUT</code>/ <code>PATCH</code>/<code>DELETE</code>). The request body sent to the OrderCloud endpoint (if any) will be passed along to the webhooks that use it.
				</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>Beyond this basic info, we've enhanced our webhooks with some other, more nuanced options:</p>
		<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
			<colgroup>
				<col width="25%">
			</colgroup>
			<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th scope="row">Elevated Roles</th>
				<td>
					Normally, OrderCloud will pass along a token that has the same roles as the original request's access token. Elevated roles are any roles that you need for your webhook that the original request's access token doesn't have (usually for subsequent requests that access information the originating user doesn't have permission to view).
				</td>
			</tr>
