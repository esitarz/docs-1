    <h2>__Delete Credit Card Overview</h2>
<p>When a customer within your buyer application deletes a credit card, the
integration endpoint can be called in order to delete that card on
OrderCloud.io as well as Authorize.Net. The Customer Payment Profile will be
removed on Authorize.Net, followed by the card being deleted on OrderCloud.io.
If either call fails, the response from that particular call will be returned.
Otherwise, the response will simply be a 204 No Content. If the card is
shared, meaning <code>Shared</code> was set to <code>true</code> when the card was created, <code>Shared</code>
must be passed as <code>true</code> when deleting.</p>
<h2>__Delete Credit Card Request</h2>
<h2>__Delete Credit Card Response</h2>
<h2>__Error Handling</h2>
<p>During the credit card delete process, the Authorize.Net Customer Payment
Profile will first be deleted. Next, the card will be deleted on
OrderCloud.io.</p>
<p>Errors will return the exact response directly from the Authorize.Net or
OrderCloud.io endpoint that failed. However, if any required fields are
missing, a 400 error will be returned before any of the update process is
executed.</p>
<h3>Validation Response</h3>
<p>In the case that a required field is missing from your request, the following
response will be returned containing a unique ErrorCode and Message, as well
as the request body sent during the call. The possible ErrorCodes and Messages
are listed below.  </p>
<table>  
<tr>
