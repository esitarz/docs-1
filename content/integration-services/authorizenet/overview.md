##  Authorize.Net Overview

[Authorize.Net](http://www.authorize.net/) enables merchants to authorize,
settle and manage credit card and electronic check transactions securely and
reliably. Authorize.Net merchants encompass a wide variety of business
industries: information, communication, government, sports, religion,
education, gourmet foods and many others. 

Regardless of their business type, merchants benefit by providing their customers with convenient, secure and reliable payment options without needing to invest in the ongoing development, support and legal compliance of a sophisticated in-house payment system.

OrderCloud.io offers a seamless integration with your Authorize.Net account to
enable credit card payments within your storefronts. This integration will not
only handle all customer and payment data with Authorize.Net (Customer
Profiles, Customer Payment Profiles, Payment Transactions), but will handle
all of the necessary OrderCloud.io endpoints as well (CreditCards, Payments,
and Transactions). Once you have an account established on Authorize.Net, all
you'Â™ll need is your API Login ID and Transaction Key to take advantage of
the various integration endpoints documented here.

> Note: OrderCloud.io does not store full Credit Card numbers in our API. We will only store the Authorize.Net token, and never the full Credit Card number.
