##  __Authorize and Capture Transaction Overview

Authorizing and Capturing a credit card transaction is one of the most
involved methods included in this integration. This method will create a new
Customer Payment Profile on Authorize.Net and credit card on OrderCloud.io if
one does not already exist, authorize and capture a payment transaction on
Authorize.Net, create a payment on OrderCloud.io tied to the authenticated
userâ€™s current Order (if a payment already exists, simply pass the ID in
`PaymentID`), and also create a transaction tied to that payment.

If the transaction authorization and capture are successful, but there is an
error while creating the payment or transaction on OrderCloud.io, the
Authorize.Net transaction will be voided.

##  __Authorize and Capture Transaction Request

This method requires either CardDetails.CreditCardID (for a previously created
card) or CardDetails.CardNumber and CardDetails.ExpirationDate (to create a
new card).

##  __Error Handling

During the authorization and capture process, the Authorize.Net payment
transaction will be created first, followed by the payment and transaction on
OrderCloud.io. In the case that the OrderCloud.io steps fail, the transaction
will be voided automatically on Authorize.Net.

Errors will return the exact response directly from the Authorize.Net or
OrderCloud.io endpoint that failed. However, if any required fields are
missing, a 400 error will be returned before any of the update process is
executed.

### Validation Response

In the case that a required field is missing from your request, the following
response will be returned containing a unique ErrorCode and Message, as well
as the request body sent during the call. The possible ErrorCodes and Messages
are listed below.

ErrorCode | Message | Status Code  
---|---|---  
AuthCaptureTransaction.OrderIDRequired | OrderID is required to authorize and
capture a credit card. | 400
