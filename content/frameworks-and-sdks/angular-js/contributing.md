The OrderCloud team welcomes any and all open-source contributors to create a
pull request for bug fixes, enhancements, or new features (pending review).

Prior to writing any code, be sure to open an issue
([Seller](https://github.com/ordercloud-api/angular-seller/issues),
[Buyer](https://github.com/ordercloud-api/angular-seller/issues)) with a
detailed description of your problem or proposed enhancement. We may already
be on our way to delivering what you want!

We use GitHub's standard [fork, branch, pull request
workflow](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) and expect
any contributors to follow a similar workflow. Always provide a passing unit
test for any fix or enhancement.

Thank you for being a part of the [OrderCloud
Community](http://community.ordercloud.io) and helping make our resources the
best they can be!
