## __Overview

Most OrderCloud.io Resources include a method for listing items from that
Resource. The results returned from a list method have a default sort order,
but you can also specify a sort order. Properties marked as “Sortable” in the
API Reference can be sorted on.

## __Sorting

Perhaps you want to sort the results by the Last Name of the person who placed
an order. To do this you can simply include the `sortBy` parameter for the
field you would like to sort by.

## __Combining Queries

Sorting can be mixed and matched with Searching and Filtering to give you
ultimate control when defining what is returned from a list.
